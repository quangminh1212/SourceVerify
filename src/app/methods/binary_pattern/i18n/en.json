    "useCase": "Detecting synthetic micro-texture patterns characteristic of AI image generators",
    "mechanism": "Computes Local Binary Pattern (LBP) descriptors by comparing each pixel with its 8 neighbors in a circular pattern. The resulting binary codes are compiled into histograms that capture micro-texture characteristics. AI-generated images produce statistically distinct LBP distributions due to their synthetic texture generation process.",

    "algorithm": "Uniform LBP + Histogram Feature Extraction",
    "parameters": "Radius: 1-3 pixels, Neighbors: 8/16/24, Pattern type: uniform/rotation-invariant, Histogram bins: 59 (uniform LBP)",

    "strengths": "• Computationally efficient and fast\n• Rotation invariant with uniform patterns\n• Captures fine-grained texture details\n• Works well across different image resolutions",
    "limitations": "• Sensitive to noise and compression artifacts\n• Limited to local texture analysis\n• May miss global structural anomalies\n• Performance degrades with heavy post-processing"
