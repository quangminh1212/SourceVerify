    "description": "Detects artifacts specific to diffusion-based AI models (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, Midjourney) by analyzing denoising step residuals and latent space patterns unique to the iterative denoising generation process.",
    "algorithm": "Diffusion Step Residual Analysis + Latent Space Pattern Detection",
    "mechanism": "The detection methodology:\n\n1. **High-frequency residual extraction**: Extracts high-frequency residuals correlating with the iterative denoising process.\n\n2. **Spatial autocorrelation**: Diffusion models operate in compressed latent space, creating characteristic spatial correlation patterns when decoded to pixel space.\n\n3. **Denoising artifact detection**: Step-by-step denoising leaves subtle but detectable traces, particularly in smooth gradient regions.\n\n4. **Cross-attention patterns**: Text-to-image diffusion models use cross-attention mechanisms creating detectable spatial coherence patterns.",
    "parameters": "Analysis window: 64x64, Noise extraction: Wiener filter\nSpatial correlation: autocorrelation maps\nTarget models: Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1/XL, DALL-E 2/3, Midjourney v4/v5/v6",
    "accuracy": "High - 86-94%. Effectiveness varies by model version and generation parameters.",
    "source": "Corvi et al. (2023) - On the Detection of Synthetic Images Generated by Diffusion Models",
    "useCase": "Detecting content from modern diffusion AI models including Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney.",
    "strengths": "• Specifically designed for modern diffusion models\n• Detects even high-quality diffusion outputs\n• Works across different diffusion architectures\n• Effective with both text-to-image and image-to-image",
    "limitations": "• Rapid model evolution requires frequent updates\n• Img2img with high denoising strength is harder to detect\n• Very small generated regions may evade detection\n• Model fine-tuning can alter detectable patterns",
