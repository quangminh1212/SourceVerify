    "strengths": "• No reference image needed\\n• Fast computation\\n• Correlates well with human perception\\n• Detects multiple distortion types",
    "limitations": "• May not detect high-quality AI images\\n• Sensitive to legitimate processing\\n• Requires calibration per domain\\n• Not specific to any forgery type"
