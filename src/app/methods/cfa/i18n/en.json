    "strengths": "• Strong indicator of real camera origin\n• Based on physical sensor hardware\n• Difficult for AI to simulate CFA patterns\n• Very low false positive rate on camera images",
    "limitations": "• Only detects presence/absence of CFA patterns\n• Some cameras apply heavy demosaicing that masks patterns\n• Resizing or heavy processing destroys CFA traces\n• Cannot identify specific camera model"
