    "useCase": "Detecting AI-generated or manipulated faces through geometric inconsistency analysis",
    "mechanism": "Detects faces and extracts 68 facial landmarks using a pre-trained shape predictor. Applies Procrustes analysis to normalize face geometry, then measures deviations from expected anatomical proportions. AI-generated faces often show subtle asymmetries and impossible geometric relationships between facial features.",
    "accuracy": "Moderate-High - 78-88% on images containing clear faces",
    "name": "Face Landmark Consistency",
    "source": "Yang et al. (2019) - Exposing Deep Fakes Using Inconsistent Head Poses, ICASSP",
    "algorithm": "68-Point Face Mesh + Procrustes Analysis",
    "parameters": "Landmarks: 68 points, Face detector: HOG/CNN, Normalization: Procrustes alignment, Metrics: inter-ocular distance ratio, symmetry score, golden ratio deviation",
    "description": "Detects inconsistencies in facial landmark positions using 68-point face mesh. AI-generated faces often have subtle geometric anomalies in eye, nose, and mouth alignment.",
    "strengths": "• Highly effective for face-specific deepfake detection\n• Based on well-understood anatomical constraints\n• Can detect subtle geometric anomalies\n• Works well with high-resolution face images",
    "limitations": "• Only applicable to images containing faces\n• Requires frontal or near-frontal face orientation\n• Performance drops with occlusions or extreme poses\n• Modern generators increasingly produce anatomically correct faces"
