Applies Procrustes analysis to normalize face geometry, then measures deviations from expected anatomical proportions. AI-generated faces often show subtle asymmetries and impossible geometric relationships between facial features.",

    "description": "Detects inconsistencies in facial landmark positions using 68-point face mesh. AI-generated faces often have subtle geometric anomalies in eye, nose, and mouth alignment.",
    "strengths": "• Highly effective for face-specific deepfake detection\n• Based on well-understood anatomical constraints\n• Can detect subtle geometric anomalies\n• Works well with high-resolution face images",
    "limitations": "• Only applicable to images containing faces\n• Requires frontal or near-frontal face orientation\n• Performance drops with occlusions or extreme poses\n• Modern generators increasingly produce anatomically correct faces",
