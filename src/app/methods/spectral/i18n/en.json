    "description": "Analyzes the frequency spectrum at Nyquist boundaries to detect upsampling artifacts. AI models often produce spectral peaks at these frequencies that are absent in real photos.",
    "algorithm": "Nyquist Frequency Spectral Analysis (2D FFT)",
    "mechanism": "Applies 2D Fast Fourier Transform to convert the image from spatial domain to frequency domain. AI-generated images exhibit characteristic spectral peaks at Nyquist frequency boundaries due to upsampling operations in generative models.",
    "parameters": "FFT size: adaptive, Window: Hann, Analysis: radial power spectrum, peak detection at f/2",
    "accuracy": "High - 80-90% for GAN-generated images with upsampling artifacts",
