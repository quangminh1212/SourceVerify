    "algorithm": "Benfords Law First-Digit Distribution Test",
    "mechanism": "Analyzes first significant digits in DCT coefficients of 8x8 image blocks. Natural images follow Benfords Law, while AI-generated images deviate from this statistical property.",
    "parameters": "Block size: 8x8, DCT coefficients: AC terms, Test: chi2 goodness-of-fit",
    "accuracy": "Moderate - 65-75%, best as complementary statistical test",
