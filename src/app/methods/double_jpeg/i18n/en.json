    "useCase": "Detecting image tampering through re-saving, quality manipulation, and spliced regions with different compression histories",
    "mechanism": "Analyzes DCT coefficient histograms for periodic patterns caused by double quantization. When a JPEG image is decompressed and re-compressed at a different quality, the DCT coefficients exhibit characteristic periodic artifacts (combing effect) in their histograms that are detectable through frequency analysis.",

    "algorithm": "DCT Coefficient Histogram Periodicity Analysis",
    "parameters": "Block size: 8x8 DCT, Quality range: 50-99, Analysis: histogram periodicity via DFT, Detection threshold: adaptive",
    "description": "Detects traces of double JPEG compression by analyzing DCT coefficient histograms. Tampering often involves re-saving, creating detectable periodic patterns in DCT domain.",
    "strengths": "• Very reliable for detecting re-saved JPEGs\n• Can estimate original compression quality\n• Localizes tampered regions\n• Mathematical foundation is well-established",
    "limitations": "• Only works on JPEG format images\n• Ineffective when both compressions use same quality\n• Cannot detect single-compressed AI images\n• Requires sufficient image size for statistical reliability"
