    "mechanism": "Analyzes pixel value distributions to detect the smoothing artifacts characteristic of median filtering. Median filtering removes high-frequency noise but leaves detectable traces in the histogram and pixel co-occurrence matrices.",
    "parameters": "Window sizes: 3×3, 5×5, 7×7; Feature: histogram bin analysis, pixel autocorrelation, streak analysis",
    "accuracy": "High — 82-94%",

    "strengths": "• Robust detection of median filtering traces\\n• Works across different window sizes\\n• Effective anti-forensic countermeasure\\n• Low false positive rate",
    "limitations": "• Cannot detect very light filtering\\n• May confuse with other smoothing filters\\n• Requires sufficient image resolution\\n• Performance degrades with heavy JPEG compression"
