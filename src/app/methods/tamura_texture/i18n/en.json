    "description": "Extracts perceptual texture features (coarseness, contrast, directionality) to identify unnatural texture characteristics typical of AI-generated images.",
    "algorithm": "Tamura Texture Feature Extraction (Coarseness + Directionality)",
    "mechanism": "Computes Tamura coarseness by analyzing local average differences at multiple scales, and directionality by computing gradient orientation histograms. AI images tend to have lower coarseness and more isotropic gradient distributions.",
    "parameters": "Scales: 5 levels (2^1 to 2^5), Gradient: Sobel operator, Orientation bins: 16",
    "accuracy": "Moderate — 65-78%, best as complementary texture signal",
