    "useCase": "Detecting AI-generated texture and style patterns through neural feature correlation analysis",
    "mechanism": "Extracts feature maps from multiple layers of a pre-trained VGG-19 network. Computes Gram matrices (inner products of feature maps) to capture style and texture correlations. AI-generated images produce characteristic Gram matrix patterns that differ from the natural texture correlations found in real photographs.",
    "accuracy": "Moderate - 73-83% for style-based detection",

    "strengths": "• Captures deep texture correlations\n• Effective across different AI architectures\n• Multi-scale analysis through multiple layers\n• Well-established theoretical foundation",
    "limitations": "• Computationally expensive (requires CNN forward pass)\n• Sensitive to image resolution changes\n• Style transfer images may create false positives\n• Requires pre-trained model weights"
