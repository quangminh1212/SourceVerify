    "useCase": "Verifying shadow consistency to detect AI generation or image compositing",
    "mechanism": "Detects shadow edges and estimates shadow direction vectors using gradient analysis. Checks that all shadows in the scene are consistent with a single (or known) light source configuration. AI images frequently produce shadows cast in contradictory directions or with inconsistent softness/hardness.",
    "accuracy": "Moderate - 68-78% on images with clearly visible shadows",
    "name": "Shadow Consistency Analysis",
    "source": "Kee et al. (2013) - Exposing Digital Forgeries from Cast Shadows, ACM TOMM",
    "algorithm": "Shadow Edge Detection + Vanishing Point Analysis",
    "parameters": "Shadow detection: chromaticity-based segmentation, Direction estimation: Radon transform on shadow boundaries, Consistency: pairwise angular comparison, Softness: penumbra width analysis",
    "description": "Analyzes shadow geometry, direction, and softness for physical plausibility. AI models struggle to maintain consistent shadow casting from a single light source.",
    "strengths": "• Physics-based approach with strong theoretical basis\n• Effective for outdoor scenes with clear shadows\n• Complements lighting analysis methods\n• Can detect both AI and manual manipulation",
    "limitations": "• Requires clearly visible shadow regions\n• Overcast/indoor scenes with soft lighting are difficult\n• Multiple light sources complicate analysis\n• Transparent or translucent objects create complex shadows"
