    "mechanism": "Detects shadow edges and estimates shadow direction vectors using gradient analysis. Checks that all shadows in the scene are consistent with a single (or known) light source configuration. AI images frequently produce shadows cast in contradictory directions or with inconsistent softness/hardness.",

    "strengths": "• Physics-based approach with strong theoretical basis\n• Effective for outdoor scenes with clear shadows\n• Complements lighting analysis methods\n• Can detect both AI and manual manipulation",
    "limitations": "• Requires clearly visible shadow regions\n• Overcast/indoor scenes with soft lighting are difficult\n• Multiple light sources complicate analysis\n• Transparent or translucent objects create complex shadows",
