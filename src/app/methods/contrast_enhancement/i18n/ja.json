    "algorithm": "Peak-Gap Artifact Detection in Pixel Value Histograms",
    "mechanism": "Contrast enhancement operations create characteristic peak-gap patterns in the pixel intensity histogram. This method detects these artifacts by analyzing the regularity and spacing of peaks and valleys.",
    "parameters": "Histogram bins: 256, Gap threshold: adaptive, Peak detection: local maxima, Smoothing: Gaussian σ=1",
    "accuracy": "High — 80-92%",
