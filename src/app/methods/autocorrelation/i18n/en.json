    "description": "Detects periodic autocorrelation peaks that suggest resampling or AI upsampling artifacts in the image structure.",
    "algorithm": "Spatial Autocorrelation Peak Analysis",
    "mechanism": "Computes the normalized autocorrelation function over grayscale pixel rows and columns at multiple lags. Periodic peaks in the autocorrelation indicate resampling artifacts from interpolation or AI upsampling, which produce predictable periodicity absent in natural images captured directly by camera sensors.",
    "parameters": "Max lag: 32 pixels, Block size: 128x128. Sampling: row+column pairs, Normalization: zero-lag division",
    "accuracy": "Moderate — 65-78%, best combined with spectral analysis",

    "limitations": "• Sensitivity drops with heavy JPEG compression\\n• Natural textures with periodic patterns cause false positives\\n• Small images may not have enough data\\n• Some AI models avoid resampling entirely"
