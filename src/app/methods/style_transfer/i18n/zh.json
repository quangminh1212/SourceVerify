    "strengths": "• Detects NST-specific artifacts\\n• Works across different style models\\n• Gram matrix features are discriminative\\n• Can detect partial style transfer",
    "limitations": "• May miss subtle style transfers\\n• Confusion with artistic filters\\n• Dependent on style transfer method\\n• Requires reference style knowledge"
