    "strengths": "• Multi-directional texture analysis through GLCM\n• Captures spatial relationships between pixels\n• Effective for detecting uniform AI textures\n• Well-established in image analysis literature",
    "limitations": "• Uniform real surfaces (walls, sky) create false positives\n• Sensitive to image resolution changes\n• Computation increases with number of distance/angle pairs\n• Post-processing can normalize texture features"
