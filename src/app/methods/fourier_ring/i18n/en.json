    "useCase": "Detecting GAN upsampling artifacts invisible to the human eye but present in frequency domain",
    "mechanism": "Computes the 2D Fast Fourier Transform and converts to polar coordinates to create a radial power spectral density profile. GAN-based upsampling operations (transposed convolution, pixel shuffle) create characteristic periodic ring patterns in the frequency domain that appear as peaks in the radial profile.",

    "parameters": "FFT size: image dimensions, Radial bins: 256, Peak detection: scipy find_peaks, Min peak prominence: 2σ above mean",

    "strengths": "• Very reliable for GAN-based generators\n• Detects artifacts invisible to humans\n• Mathematically well-founded\n• Fast computation via FFT",
    "limitations": "• Less effective for diffusion models\n• JPEG compression can mask spectral artifacts\n• Small images reduce frequency resolution\n• May produce false positives on regularly textured images"
