    "algorithm": "Sensor-Based Camera Source Identification via Processing Pipeline Analysis",
    "mechanism": "Each camera model has a unique processing pipeline including CFA interpolation, white balancing, color correction, and JPEG compression. This method extracts features from these processing steps to identify the source camera.",
    "parameters": "Features: color processing, CFA interpolation, JPEG tables, Classifier: SVM/RF, Training: per-model",
    "accuracy": "High — 85-96%",
