    "useCase": "Localizing manipulated regions and creating manipulation probability heatmaps",
    "mechanism": "Divides the image into overlapping patches and classifies each independently using a lightweight CNN. Creates a spatial probability map showing manipulation likelihood per region. Aggregates patch-level predictions for an overall assessment. Effective at localizing manipulated regions within an image.",
    "accuracy": "Moderate-High - 80-88% for detecting local manipulations",
    "name": "Patch-based Forensics (CNN)",
    "source": "Chai et al. (2020) - What Makes Fake Images Detectable? Understanding Properties that Generalize, ECCV",
    "algorithm": "Sliding Window CNN Patch Classifier",
    "parameters": "Patch size: 128x128, Stride: 64, CNN: custom lightweight (4 conv layers), Aggregation: mean + max pooling of patch scores",
    "description": "Uses CNN classifiers on small image patches to detect local manipulations. Each patch is independently classified, creating a manipulation probability map.",
    "strengths": "• Provides spatial localization of manipulations\n• Lightweight and fast inference\n• Generalizes across different manipulation types\n• Can detect partial image manipulations",
    "limitations": "• Small patch size may miss global inconsistencies\n• Boundary effects between patches\n• Performance depends on training data diversity\n• May struggle with full-image generation (no local boundaries)"
