    "description": "Compares embedded EXIF thumbnail with the main image to detect post-capture modifications.",
    "algorithm": "Embedded Thumbnail vs Main Image Structural Comparison",
    "mechanism": "JPEG files often contain embedded thumbnails generated at capture time. When the main image is later edited, the thumbnail may remain unchanged, creating detectable inconsistencies.",
    "parameters": "Comparison: SSIM, Histogram correlation, Pixel hash, Thumbnail source: EXIF APP1, Resolution: 160×120",
    "accuracy": "Medium-High — 75-90%",

    "strengths": "• Simple and fast analysis\\n• High confidence when thumbnail differs\\n• Non-invasive metadata check\\n• Works on any JPEG with embedded thumbnail",
    "limitations": "• Many images lack embedded thumbnails\\n• Some editors update thumbnails too\\n• AI-generated images may not have thumbnails\\n• Limited to JPEG format"
