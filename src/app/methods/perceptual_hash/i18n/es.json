    "strengths": "• Very fast computation\\n• Rotation and scale tolerant\\n• Compact representation\\n• Good for batch comparison",
    "limitations": "• Limited sensitivity to subtle changes\\n• Cannot localize specific manipulations\\n• Hash collisions possible\\n• Not suitable for fine-grained analysis"
