    "mechanism": "Applies 30 hand-crafted high-pass filters from the Spatial Rich Model to extract noise residuals at different scales and orientations. These residuals capture subtle statistical regularities in the noise domain. A Truncated Linear Unit (TLU) activation constrains residual values, enhancing discrimination between natural sensor noise and synthetic noise patterns.",

    "strengths": "• Captures diverse noise patterns with 30 specialized filters\n• Originally proven effective in steganalysis\n• Multi-scale and multi-directional analysis\n• Works well on high-quality images",
    "limitations": "• Computationally intensive with 30 filter passes\n• Heavy compression destroys subtle noise patterns\n• Requires sufficient image resolution\n• Performance varies across different AI architectures",
